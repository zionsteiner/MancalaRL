Problem: Pygame or Tkinter?
Which will be easier to expose the game API to the algorithms?
Or algos don't have to directly use game API. It can be a separate handler, then it wouldn't matter what changes I make
to either, I only have to change the handler.

class Algo:
    # how to define state, move?
    def move(state) -> move

class Mancala:
    self.board
    self.player1
    self.player2

    def init()
    def start()
    def calc_results()

class Board:
    self.spaces

class Player:
    def move
